## The Two Problems Nobody Has Solved Together

**Problem 1: Claude forgets everything between sessions.**

Every time you open Claude Code, you get: *"So, what are we working on today?"*
You've spent 6 sessions building an auth system. Claude remembers none of it.

**Problem 2: Sessions hit context limits way too fast.**

You spend 1,200-3,000 tokens re-explaining your project before doing any
real work. That's 10-25% of your session burned on warm-up. Over 10 sessions,
that's **12,000-30,000 tokens wasted** just getting Claude back to baseline.

## One Skill Fixes Both

Install memory-bank. Now you get this:

```
Welcome back! Last session you finished the Stripe webhook handler in
src/api/webhooks/stripe.ts — handlePaymentSuccess() is complete but
handleRefund() is still stubbed out. 3 commits have landed since, all
yours. The next step is writing integration tests for the webhook
endpoint. Ready to go?

Memory health: 9/10 | Branch: feature/checkout | Session 7
Context used for warm-up: ~800 tokens (vs ~3,000 without memory-bank)
```

No re-explaining. No lost context. No wasted tokens. **Sessions last 3-5x longer.**

---

## Token Savings

Real numbers. No fluff.

```
WITHOUT memory-bank (every session):
  Re-explain project:     ~400-800 tokens
  Re-explain decisions:   ~300-600 tokens
  Re-explain current work: ~200-500 tokens
  Clarification Q&A:      ~500-1,500 tokens
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Total waste per session: ~1,400-3,400 tokens

WITH memory-bank (every session):
  Compact memory load:    ~200-800 tokens (structured, complete)
  Re-explanation:         0 tokens
  Clarification:          0 tokens
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Total cost per session: ~200-800 tokens

  SAVINGS: 60-80% fewer tokens on context loading
```

| Metric | Without | With memory-bank |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Warm-up tokens per session | 1,400-3,400 | 200-800 |
| Token savings per session | — | 1,200-2,600 |
| Savings over 10 sessions | — | **12,000-26,000** |
| Sessions before context limit | Baseline | **3-5x more** |
| Time to productive work | 2-5 minutes | **Instant** |

### How It Saves Tokens

| Technique | Savings | How |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Structured memory vs re-explaining | 800-1,500/session | Compact format replaces verbal explanation |
| Progressive loading (load only what's needed) | 300-600/session | Skip irrelevant sections |
| Compact encoding (tables > prose) | 200-400/session | Same info, 50% fewer tokens |
| Session continuation protocol | 500-1,000/handoff | Zero warm-up after context limits |
| Smart compression | 200-500/session | Smaller file = fewer tokens to read |
| Concise Claude responses | 300-800/session | Claude optimizes its own output |

## Install

```bash
npx skills add Nagendhra-web/memory-bank/skills/memory-bank
```

Then add the auto-setup to your `CLAUDE.md` (or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for all projects):

```markdown
## Memory

At the start of every session:
1. Check for MEMORY.md in the project root
2. Check current git branch for .memory/branches/<branch>.md overlay
3. Run a quick session diff — what changed since last update
4. Greet me with a specific summary and the next immediate step

At session end (when I say "wrap up", "save", or "done for now"):
1. Write comprehensive MEMORY.md with full current state
2. Make "Next immediate step" crystal clear
3. Compress if over 150 lines
```

That's it. Claude now remembers everything, forever.

## Features

This is not a simple note-taker. It's an adaptive memory engine.

### Layered Memory Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 2: GLOBAL MEMORY                     │
│  ~/.claude/GLOBAL-MEMORY.md                 │
│  Your preferences across ALL projects.      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1: PROJECT MEMORY                    │
│  ./MEMORY.md + branch overlays              │
│  Architecture, decisions, active work.      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 0: SESSION CONTEXT                   │
│  Current conversation only.                 │
│  Auto-flushes to Layer 1 at session end.    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Layer 0 captures what you're doing now. Layer 1 tracks the project. Layer 2 remembers *you* across every project — your tool preferences, coding style, patterns you always use.

### Branch-Aware Memory

Switch branches, switch context. Automatically.

```
MEMORY.md                          ← base project memory
.memory/
  branches/
    feature-auth.md                ← auth context
    feature-payments.md            ← payments context
    bugfix-race-condition.md       ← bugfix context
```

Working on `feature/auth`? Claude loads the auth overlay. Switch to `feature/payments`? Different context loads instantly. Merge a branch? Claude folds the overlay back into base memory and cleans up.

No more "wait, weren't we working on payments?" when you're on the auth branch.

### Smart Compression

Memory files grow. Uncompressed memory becomes noise. Smart Compression keeps it lean:

| Lines | Action |
|-------|--------|
| < 100 | No action |
| 100-150 | Suggests compression |
| 150-200 | Auto-compresses |
| > 200 | Emergency compression + archive |

Completed tasks get collapsed. Resolved blockers get removed. Stale entries get flagged. **Key decisions and architecture notes are NEVER compressed** — they're permanent project knowledge.

Old session history moves to `MEMORY-ARCHIVE.md` so nothing is truly lost.

### Session Diffing

When you start a new session, Claude doesn't just read memory — it diffs against reality:

- **Git analysis:** What commits landed since your last session? By you? By teammates?
- **File validation:** Do all the files mentioned in memory still exist? Were any renamed?
- **Conflict detection:** Does memory say "using Express" while `package.json` has Fastify?
- **Dependency tracking:** Any new packages added or removed?

```
Since your last session (3 days ago): 7 commits — 4 by you, 3 by
@teammate. src/api/users.ts was refactored, 2 new deps added (zod,
@tanstack/query). Memory reference to src/auth.ts is stale — file
was renamed to src/authentication.ts. Auto-correcting.
```

### Memory Health Scoring

Every session start, memory gets a health score:

```
Memory health: 8/10
  Freshness:     9/10 (updated yesterday)
  Relevance:     7/10 (2 file paths changed)
  Completeness:  8/10 (all sections filled)
  Actionability: 9/10 (next step is crystal clear)
```

Health below 5? Claude suggests a rebuild. Below 3? Recovery mode kicks in.

### Recovery Mode

When memory is corrupted, severely stale, or missing:

1. Scans `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `go.mod` for stack detection
2. Reads last 20 git commits for recent activity
3. Checks README and CLAUDE.md for project context
4. Reconstructs memory from code reality
5. Presents it: "I've rebuilt memory from your code. Does this look right?"

Your project is never truly lost.

### Handoff Protocol

Onboarding a new developer? Generate a handoff document:

```
"generate a handoff for this project"
```

Claude reads memory + git history + code and produces a complete handoff: quick start instructions, architecture overview, active work, key decisions with reasoning, and gotchas. Optimized for humans, not AI.

### Velocity Tracking

After 5+ sessions, ask "how's our velocity?" and get:

- Tasks completed per session (trending up or down?)
- Recurring blockers (same issue appearing 3+ times)
- Scope creep detection (active work growing faster than completed?)
- Estimated sessions remaining for current work

### Context Efficiency Engine

The feature nobody else has built. Memory Bank actively minimizes token usage:

**Progressive Loading** — Don't dump everything into context. Load in tiers:
- Tier 1 (always): Project overview + where we left off + blockers (~200 tokens)
- Tier 2 (on demand): Key decisions, files, architecture (~300 tokens, only when needed)
- Tier 3 (rare): Session log, preferences, external context (~200 tokens, most sessions skip)

**Compact Encoding** — Tables instead of prose (50% fewer tokens for same info). Checklists instead of descriptions. File:line references instead of code snippets. Every line maximizes information per token.

**Context Budget Tracking** — Claude monitors usage and warns at milestones:
- 50%: suggests `/compact`
- 60%: auto-checkpoints memory
- 75%: recommends starting fresh
- 85%: emergency save

**Concise Response Mode** — Claude optimizes its own output during memory-bank sessions. Leads with results, uses file:line refs, skips preamble.

### Session Continuation Protocol

**The session killer, killed.** When you hit context limits or want to continue later:

1. Claude writes `CONTINUATION.md` — an ultra-compact warm-up file (under 50 lines, under 500 tokens)
2. Contains the exact resume point: file, function, line number
3. Contains what's done, what's half-done, and the immediate next action
4. Next session loads it first — **zero warm-up, instant productivity**

```
"Context is at 82%. I've saved everything. Start a new session and say
'continue' — I'll pick up at src/auth/refresh.ts:47 with zero warm-up."
```

```
Next session:
"Resuming from CONTINUATION.md. You were implementing handleRefund() in
route.ts:89 — handlePaymentSuccess() is done, refund handler needs the
Stripe refund.created event wired up. Let's go."
```

No more losing work when sessions end. No more re-explaining when they start.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Install the skill**

```bash
npx skills add Nagendhra-web/memory-bank/skills/memory-bank
```

**2. Start a session with Claude Code**

Claude will offer to create your first `MEMORY.md` after meaningful work.

**3. End your session**

Say "wrap up" or "save progress". Claude writes everything to `MEMORY.md`.

**4. Start your next session**

Claude reads `MEMORY.md` and greets you with exactly where you left off. Zero re-explaining.
